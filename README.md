# BuBook


I have developed this project for student of B.tech (CSE) of Bundelkhand University. This is my idea to build a webiste where we student can find all relevent books and papers.
Student can read or download content .There is different category. I build this project using PHP and MySQL data base. This project has users and admin panel. Admin panel is for update content etc on the users side.
